        <p>
          <strong>Air</strong> is a mixture of gases that is composed of 78% Nitrogen, 21% Oxygen
          and a very small percentage of water vapor and other gases. The fact
          that air contains so much oxygen is not because the earth provided us
          the atmosphere with that composition, but because living things like
          plants produced oxygen for over 2 billion of years ago from carbon
          dioxide.

        <p>
          <strong>Water</strong> is called the medium of life. All life on the planet requires
          water (there are some forms of life that can live without air) because
          all the chemical reactions that occur in living cells occur using
          water as a medium. Water is found in large bodies like the ocean,
          seas, rivers, and lakes. It is also found in the atmosphere as vapour
          and as a solid in snow, glaciers and ice shelves.

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil" target="_blank"><h3>Soil</h3></a>
        <p>
          The minerals useful for life are found in the upper crust of the
          earth. But most of these are found in rocks, which cannot be used by
          plants or animal. Instead, we need them crushed in small particles
          which we call <strong>soil</strong>. The soil is formed by the breaking up of rocks by
          various geological, climatic and biological processes. Soil contains
          minerals such as Iron, Zinc, Nitrogen compounds, etc.
